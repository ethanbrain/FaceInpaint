# Occluded Facial Image Retrieval and Reconstruction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to enhance facial image retrieval and reconstruction, even when input images are partially occluded. Using a combination of GANs, image retrieval models, and metric evaluation, this system can retrieve and restore facial features from obscured images effectively.

## Features
- **GAN-based Image Completion**: Utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct occluded facial images.
- **Image Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves images similar to the target, assisting in facial recognition tasks.
- **Custom Model Training**: Trains a model from scratch for specific retrieval tasks with tailored metrics.
- **Inpainting**: Fills missing or occluded parts of images for improved analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download `model.pth` from the provided link and place it in the project folder.

## Usage
To run the main application:
```bash
python App_Retrieval_Occluded_Facial_Image.py
```

## Example
Below is a comparison of input and output images generated by the project:
- **Input**: Partially occluded image
- **Output**: Fully reconstructed image

## Future Improvements
- Enhance GAN model performance for more realistic reconstructions.
- Integrate more efficient retrieval algorithms.
